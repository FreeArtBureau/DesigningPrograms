02_SUPERFORMS


What I call superforms refer to the creation of complex images from repetition of simple shapes. In this set of sketches there are a number of examples of how to use the FOR loop used to repeat instructions in a program. This repetition can be put to good use graphically, making basic yet quite interesting patterns. 

There is also a pdf presentation which I had put together for a workshop specifically on FOR loops and oriented towards making pattern generators. Although some slides may not communicate much (part of a presentation), you'll find some reference images that could be of interest from a number of artists adn graphic designers. Note that at time of writing, GitHub does not allow the displaying of PDF format, so you'll only be able to see it once downloaded.
