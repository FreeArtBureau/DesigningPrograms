In this example we directly work on byte information of an image.

CHECK THIS INFORMATION & GET IT RIGHT ! ! ! 

Bytes are the smallest addressable unit of memory in most computers.
1B = 8 bits > 1 byte is equal to 8 bits 
(Notice the abbreviation of Bytes as capital B to differentiate from 1b ( one bit )
/////////////////////////

NB. Different standards through history mean that we often have different abbreviations :

1kB = kilo byte = 1000 bytes
1kb = kilo bit = 1000 bits

One kilobyte (kB) = 2x10 bytes = 1024 bytes (pre-1998 standard)
One kilobyte (kB) = 1000 bytes (IEC Standard)

These numbers are described in a decimal system (0,1,2,3,4...). It must be remebered that computer 
storage systems are based on a binary system - therefore multiples of 2. 
So when we say a computer has 100GB of storage,it actually has 93 GiB.

/////////////////////////
For a byte, the smallest number possible is 0 (represented by eight zeroes, 00000000)
and the largest is 255 (represented by eight ones, 11111111), 
making for 256 different possible values. Now you know why the number 255 is used a lot in programming ;â€“)

///////////////////////// 
1 bit of information / 1b (abbreaviation b lowercase), means binary digit and is equal
to either 0 or 1.

With 2 bits you have the possibility of storing 4 pieces of information (2x2) :
0 | 0
0 | 1
1 | 0
1 | 1

With 3 bits we have the possibility of storing 8 pieces of information (2x2x2) :

000
001
010
011
100
101
110
111
