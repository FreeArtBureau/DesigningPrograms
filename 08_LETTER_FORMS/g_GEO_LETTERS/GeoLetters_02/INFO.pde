 CODING FOR GRAPHIC DESIGN STUDENTS.
 
 IMPLEMENTED BY THE FREE ART BUREAU 2012/13

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 LETTER FORMS : GEO LETTERS
 SKETCH : GEO_LETTERS_02
 PARENT SKETCH : NONE
 TYPE : AUTONOMOUS
 
 **NB
 
 In this series of sketches we develop a class that will be used
 to create letters using geomerative. The class will give us the
 possibility to initiate a new letter with a number of parameters
 for movement and eventually display (eg. number of points...)
  
 In this sketch we have a letter class that basically incorporates
 the necesary methods and classes of the Geomerative class. 
 This class enables us to initiate a letter of the alphabet, declare its font size,
 and the number of points on that letter.
 
 It uses PVectors to position and move points on each letter independantly.
