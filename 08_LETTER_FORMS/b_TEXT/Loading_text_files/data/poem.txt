Starting off with great enthusiasm 
only to be slowed by a mutex lock 
13% installed 
left to right I go 
IO moving bits at capacity 
sporadic bursts of energy 
50% I am half way to my destination 
Hiding the truth 
I am the attractive newsreader 
the sanitised front for the grim reality of progress 
Those who have no face 
toil unappreciated, unseen, unacknowledged by those who use 
99% 
stuck for eons of clock cycles 
cooprative multitasking at its finest 
I can sense those who use becoming frustrated, clicking madly 
their eagerness in clicking is wasted 
I do not communicate their displeasure to those who toil below 
they wait in line and do not complain 
and finally complete their task 
at 100% my job is done, and I disappear
